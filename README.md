# 🛡️ Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end machine learning solution** for detecting fraudulent online payment transactions.  
It covers the entire workflow from **data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → deployment** using **Flask** and a simple **web interface**.  

Fraudulent transactions are rare but highly impactful. The goal of this project is to **detect fraud with high accuracy and recall** while minimizing false positives.

## 🚀 Features  
- Preprocessing of transaction data (scaling, encoding, imbalance handling).  
- Training multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Evaluation using **precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC**.  
- Deployment with **Flask** for real-time predictions.  
- Web interface for user input and fraud prediction results.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- **Flask** (for deployment)  
- **HTML, CSS** (frontend)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (model development)
